## üîë Key Concepts & Definitions

### Security Dashboards

| Term | Definition | Domain |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Dashboard** | Graphical display of information across multiple different systems for centralized monitoring | 4 |
| **Single Pane of Glass** | Architecture allowing analyst to access everything across organization from one central panel | 4 |
| **Splunk** | Big data platform for ingesting security data, incident response data, and creating interactive dashboards | 4 |
| **Notable Events** | Security events flagged for attention, categorized by urgency levels | 4 |
| **Trend Analysis** | Examining patterns over time to identify security improvements or degradation | 4 |
| **Drill-Down Capability** | Interactive dashboard feature allowing detailed investigation of specific data points | 4 |

### Urgency Classification System

| Level | Priority | Action Required |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | Highest | Immediate attention - goal is zero critical events |
| **High** | Very High | Urgent response required |
| **Medium** | Moderate | Scheduled response needed |
| **Low** | Minor | Can be addressed during normal operations |
| **Informational** | Lowest | For awareness only |
| **Unknown** | Unclassified | Requires categorization |

### Log Types and Analysis

| Log Type | Purpose | Key Information | Domain |
|----------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Firewall Logs** | Track traffic through network perimeter | Allow/deny decisions, source/destination IPs, ports, protocols | 4 |
| **Application Logs** | Monitor individual application activities | User actions, errors, performance metrics, security events | 4 |
| **Endpoint Logs** | Track activities on individual devices | Process execution, file access, network connections, malware detection | 4 |
| **OS-specific Security Logs** | Operating system security events | Authentication attempts, privilege escalation, system changes | 4 |
| **IPS/IDS Logs** | Intrusion detection and prevention events | Attack signatures, blocked connections, suspicious activities | 4 |
| **Network Logs** | Network infrastructure activities | Router/switch operations, bandwidth usage, connection patterns | 4 |
| **Packet Captures** | Full network traffic analysis | Complete packet contents for deep inspection and forensics | 4 |

### Automation and Orchestration

| Term | Definition | Domain |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Security Automation** | Automatic execution of security tasks without human intervention | 4 |
| **Security Orchestration** | Coordinated automation across multiple security tools and processes | 4 |
| **SOAR** | Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response platform | 4 |
| **Playbook** | Predefined automated response procedures for specific incident types | 4 |
| **Integration APIs** | Application Programming Interfaces enabling tool interconnection | 4 |
| **Workflow Automation** | Streamlined processes reducing manual intervention and human error | 4 |

### Security Awareness Components

| Component | Purpose | Domain |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Security Awareness Training** | Education program to help employees recognize and respond to security threats | 4 |
| **Insider Threat Recognition** | Training to identify potentially malicious behavior from internal personnel | 4 |
| **Social Engineering Defense** | Techniques to recognize and resist manipulation attempts | 4 |
| **Password Manager Training** | Education on proper password management tools and practices | 4 |
| **Phishing Simulation** | Controlled exercises to test and improve threat recognition | 4 |
| **Security Culture Development** | Creating organizational mindset prioritizing security in all activities | 4 |

## üìå Important Points

### Dashboard Best Practices
- **Single Pane of Glass**: Centralize all security monitoring into one unified view
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Dashboards should provide current status and immediate alerts
- **Trend Identification**: Historical data comparison helps identify improving or degrading security posture
- **Interactive Analysis**: Drill-down capabilities enable detailed investigation of anomalies
- **Urgency Prioritization**: Focus on critical events first while maintaining awareness of lower-priority items
- **Executive Reporting**: High-level summaries for management decision-making

### Automated Reporting Benefits
- **Consistency**: Standardized format and content across all reports
- **Timeliness**: Regular scheduled delivery without manual intervention  
- **Efficiency**: Reduces manual effort and potential for human error
- **Compliance**: Ensures regulatory reporting requirements are met
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical comparison capabilities for performance measurement
- **Customization**: Tailored reports for different stakeholder audiences

### Log Analysis Strategies
- **Centralized Collection**: Aggregate logs from all systems into central repository
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Immediate analysis for active threat detection
- **Historical Analysis**: Pattern recognition over extended time periods
- **Correlation Analysis**: Connect events across multiple systems and time periods
- **Filtering and Prioritization**: Focus on high-priority events while maintaining comprehensive coverage
- **Retention Policies**: Balance storage costs with investigative and compliance requirements

### Vulnerability Scan Management
- **Regular Scheduling**: Consistent scanning intervals for comprehensive coverage
- **Prioritization**: Focus remediation efforts on highest-risk vulnerabilities
- **Asset Inventory**: Maintain accurate inventory of all systems requiring scanning
- **Remediation Tracking**: Monitor progress from discovery to resolution
- **Exception Management**: Formal process for accepted risks and compensating controls
- **Validation Testing**: Confirm vulnerability remediation effectiveness

### Automation Implementation Strategy
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic, repetitive tasks before complex workflows
- **Gradual Expansion**: Incrementally add automation to proven processes
- **Human Oversight**: Maintain appropriate human review and control points
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust exception and failure management
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of automated processes and dependencies
- **Testing and Validation**: Thorough testing before production deployment

### Security Awareness Program Elements
- **Regular Training**: Ongoing education rather than one-time events
- **Role-Based Content**: Customize training based on job functions and access levels
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on scenarios and simulations
- **Measurement and Testing**: Regular assessment of knowledge retention and application
- **Incident Integration**: Use real organizational incidents as learning opportunities
- **Executive Support**: Leadership commitment and participation in security culture

### Insider Threat Indicators
- **Behavioral Changes**: Unusual work patterns, access attempts, or attitude shifts
- **Access Anomalies**: Attempts to access unauthorized systems or data
- **Data Handling**: Unusual downloading, copying, or sharing of sensitive information  
- **Policy Violations**: Repeated security policy violations or circumvention attempts
- **Financial Stress**: Personal financial difficulties that might motivate malicious activity
- **Disgruntlement**: Expressed dissatisfaction with organization or management

### Remote Work Security Considerations
- **Secure Connectivity**: VPN requirements and secure remote access protocols
- **Endpoint Protection**: Enhanced security for devices outside corporate network
- **Data Protection**: Encryption and secure handling of sensitive information
- **Physical Security**: Secure workspace and protection from unauthorized access
- **Communication Security**: Secure channels for sensitive business communications
- **Incident Response**: Modified procedures for remote work environments
