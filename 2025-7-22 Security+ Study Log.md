| **BlueBorne**                                  | Set of vulnerabilities in Bluetooth technology that can allow an attacker to take over devices or spread malware                                                            |
| **BlueSmack**                                  | Type of Denial of Service attack that targets Bluetooth-enabled devices by sending a specially crafted Logical Link Control and Adaption Protocol packet to a target device |
| **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** | Specific methods and patterns of activities or behaviors associated with a particular threat actor or group of threat actors                                                |
| **Deceptive and Disruption Technologies**      | Designed to mislead, confuse and divert attackers from critical assets while simultaneously detecting and neutralizing threats                                              |
| **Bogus DNS**                                  | Fake DNS entries introduced into a systems DNS server                                                                                                                       |
| **Decoy Directories**                          | Fake folder and files placed within a systems storage                                                                                                                       |
| **Dynamic Page Generation**                    | Used in websites to present ever-changing content to web crawlers to confuse and slow down the threat actor                                                                 |
| **Port Triggering**                            | Security mechanism where specific services or ports on a network device remain closed until a specific outbound traffic pattern is detected                                 |
| **Fake Telemetry Data**                        | System can respond to an attackers network scan attempt by sending out fake telemetry or network data                                                                       |

### Important Points

- **Insider Threats**
    - They have preexisting knowledge and access
    - They know procedures
    - varying levels of capabilities
    - data theft sabotage abuse of privileges 
    - Financial gain or revenge possibly lack of awareness
- **Shadow IT**
    - use of personal devices for work purposes, Installation of unapproved software, use of cloud services that have not been approved by the organization
    - USB drives, External hard drives, keyboard wired mouse or network adapter could open vulnerabilities to the network
    - Plugins or extensions
- **Threat Vectors and attack surfaces
    - Messages,Images, Files, Voice calls, Removable Devices, Unsecured networks
    - BlueBorn and Bluesmack for Bluetooth devices
- **Attack Surfaces
    - Restricting Access, Removing unnecessary software, Disabling unused protocols increases security posture 
    - Messaging applications or external devices can open avenues to threats
- **Outsmart Threat Actors
	-  Deception and disrution to threat actors - Honeypots, Honeynets, Honeyfiles, Honeytokens
	- Honey pot
		- Enterprise network place it within a screened subnet or isolated segment that is easily accessed by potential attacks
	- Honeynets
		- Honeynet logs all activities to provide a wealth of data about both successful and unsuccessful attacks
	- Honeypots and honeynets both have risks that the attacker could use to learn how production systems are configured
	- Honeyfile
		- word-processing document, spreadsheets, presentation files, images database files executable
		- unique identifiers or watermarks to identify if stolen
	- Honeytoken
		- useful for detecting insider threats
		- help identify data leaks
- Disruptions include using bogus DNS entries, Creating decoy directories generating dynamic pages, using port triggering, spoofing fake telemetry data
