| **Hashing**                                  | Technique that converts data into a fixed size of numerical or alphanumeric characters, known as a hash value                                         |

| **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**               | Set up to monitor the data of a system while it's in use, in transit, or at rest in order to detect any attempts to steal the data                    |
| **Endpoint DLP Sytem**                       | A piece of software that's installed on a workstation or a laptop, and it's going to monitor the data that's in use on that computer                  |
| **Network DLP System**                       | A piece of software or hardware that's a solution placed at the perimeter of the network to detect data in transit                                    |
| **Storage DLP**                              | A software that is installed on a server in the data center and inspects the data while it's at rest on the server                                    |
| **Cloud-based DLP System**                   | Usually offered as software-as-a-service, and it's part of the cloud service and storage needs                                                        |
