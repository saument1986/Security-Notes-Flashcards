### Important Points

**Symmetric Encryption:**
- **Symmetric vs Asymmetric**: Symmetric uses same key for encryption/decryption, asymmetric uses different keys
- **DES Weakness**: Only 56-bit effective key length, vulnerable to modern computing power
- **AES Dominance**: Most commonly used and strongest symmetric algorithm covered
- **RC4 Exception**: Only symmetric cipher discussed that is a stream cipher (all others are block ciphers)
- **Government Standard**: AES is the encryption standard used by federal government for sensitive but unclassified information
- **Historical Context**: DES used from 1970s to early 2000s before being replaced by stronger algorithms
- **Open Source Options**: Both Blowfish and Twofish were never patented and released as open source
- **RC Evolution**: RC1 never published, RC2 considered weak, RC3 cracked before release, RC4-RC6 commonly used

**Asymmetric Encryption:**
- **Four Security Services**: Public key cryptography provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation
- **Confidentiality**: Encrypt with receiver's public key - only receiver can decrypt with their private key
- **Non-repudiation**: Encrypt with sender's private key - proves sender identity since only they have the private key
- **Digital Signatures**: Hash message + encrypt hash with sender's private key = integrity + non-repudiation
- **Key Exchange Usage**: Diffie-Hellman commonly used for VPN tunnel establishment and IPSec
- **RSA Applications**: Used in secure tokens for multifactor authentication (6-digit changing numbers)
- **ECC Efficiency**: 6x more efficient than RSA - 256-bit ECC = 2048-bit RSA security level
- **Mobile Optimization**: ECC preferred for mobile devices due to lower processing power requirements
- **Vulnerability**: Diffie-Hellman susceptible to on-path/person-in-the-middle attacks without authentication

**Hashing:**
- **One-way Function**: Cannot reverse hash to get original message - acts as digital fingerprint
- **Fixed Length Output**: Hash digest always same length regardless of input size
- **Collision Vulnerability**: Two different inputs producing same hash (especially problematic with MD5)
- **SHA Evolution**: SHA-1 (160-bit) â†’ SHA-2 (224-512 bit) â†’ SHA-3 (more secure with 120 rounds)
- **Digital Signature Process**: Hash file â†’ encrypt hash with private key â†’ attach to message
- **Code Signing**: Used for mobile apps and software to ensure integrity and authenticity
- **Hash Sensitivity**: Changing even one character drastically changes entire hash output

**Hash Security:**
- **Pass-the-Hash Defense**: Use trusted OS, proper domain trusts, patching, MFA, least privilege
- **Birthday Attack Prevention**: Use longer hash digests (SHA-256 over MD5) to reduce collisions
- **Key Stretching**: Apply hash function multiple times to make brute force more expensive
- **Salting Benefits**: Defeats dictionary attacks, brute force attacks, and rainbow tables
- **Nonce Usage**: Prevents replay attacks by ensuring different outputs each time
- **Account Lockout**: Limit failed login attempts (typically 3) to slow down attackers

**PKI and Digital Certificates:**
- **PKI vs Public Key Crypto**: PKI is entire system, public key crypto is just encryption/decryption part
- **HTTPS Process**: Browser gets server's public key from CA â†’ encrypts shared secret â†’ establishes symmetric tunnel
- **Certificate Types**: Single-use, wildcard (*.domain.com), SAN (multiple domains), single/dual-sided
- **Trust Chain**: Root CA â†’ Intermediate CA â†’ End Entity Certificate (like family tree)
- **Certificate Management**: CSR generation â†’ CA validation â†’ certificate issuance â†’ revocation if needed
- **Revocation Methods**: CRL (full list), OCSP (single lookup), OCSP stapling (included in handshake)
- **Security Measures**: Public key pinning prevents impersonation, key escrow enables recovery
- **X.509 Standard**: Common format for digital certificates containing identity and public key info
