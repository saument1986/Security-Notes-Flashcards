### Important Points

- Overclassifying data leads to protecting all data at a high level
- Classification is based on whether you are a commercial business or Government organization
- **Business**
	- Public
		- Has no impact on the company if released and is often posted in an open-source environment
	- Sensitive
		- Has minimal impact if released (Organization's financial data)
	- Private
		- Contains data that should only be used within the organization
		- Relates to an individual entity
	- Confidential
		- Contains items such as trade secrets, intellectual property data, and source code that affect the business if disclosed
	- Critical
		- Contains valuable information
		- ex: credit card information
- **Government classifications**
	- Unclassified
		- Data that can be released to the public or under the Freedom of Information Act
	- Sensitive but unclassified
		- Data that would not hurt national security if released but could impact those whose data was being used
		- Ex: Medical records
	- Confidential
		- Data that could seriously affect the government if unauthorized disclosures happen
	- Secret
		- Data that could seriously damage national security if disclosed
	- Top Secret
		- Data that would damage national security if disclosed
- **Life Cycle**
	- Collect
	- Retain
	- Dispose
	- Should be defined in policies
	- Follow the local,state,and government laws and regulations for data retention time requirements
- **Data Owner**
	- Ultimate responsibility
	- labels assets and determines protection level
- **Data Controller**
	- Holds ultimate accountability
- **Data Processor**
	- Work at the direction of the data controller
- **Data Steward**
	- Ensures data is appropriately labeled and classified
- **Data Custodian**
	- System administrators
- **Privacy Officer**
	- is on the hook for data breach
	- Make sure you are compliant
- The Data owner should be a business entity responsible for creating this information, with each owner being assigned to their own department
- IT people should not be the data owners, but rather those who know more about the data based on the content of the company
**Data States**
- Data at Rest
	- Not actively moving
	- prime target for threat actors
	- best if encrypted
		- Full Disk Encryption
			- Encrypts the entire hard drive
		- Partition Encryption
			- Encrypts specific partitions of a hard drive
		- File Encryption
			- Encrypts individual files
		- Volume Encryption
			- Encrypts a set of selected files or directories
		- Database Encryption
			- Encrypts data stored in a database
		- Record Encryption
			- Encrypts specific fields within a database record
-  **Data in Transit**
	- Vulnerable to interception 
	- Encryption methods
		- SSL, TLS, VPN's and IPSec
		- SSL and TLS
			- Cryptiographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network
		- VPN
			- Technology that creates a secure connection over a less secure network
		- IPSec
			- Protocol suite used to secure IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in a data stream
- **Data in Use**
	-  actively being processed
