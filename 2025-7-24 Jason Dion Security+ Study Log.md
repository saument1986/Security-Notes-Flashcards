### Important Points

- **Social Engineering**
	- The backbone of social engineering lies in the ability of an attacker to trick a user into something something for them
	- Motovational triggers
		- Authority 
			- pretending to be IRS
		- Urgency
			- They use sense of urgency to get the organizations employees to ignore or bypass their normal security procedures
		- Social proof
			- using likes and shares to influence people into visiting malicious sites
			- online marketing uses social proofing all the time
		- scarcity
			- Limited supplies 
		- likability
			- draw people into sphere of influence to gain trust
			- sexual attraction
			- pretending to be a friend
			- common interest
		- fear
			- Ransomware
			- Fear and authority
- **Impersonation**
	- Impersonation
		- The attacker must first collect information about the organization so that they can more easily earn the trust of their targeted users
		- Providing details helps to make the lies and the attacker's impersonation more believable to potential victim
		- can lead to unauthorized access, disruption of services, complete system takeover
	- Brand Impersonation
		- attackers use the brand's logos, language, and info to create deceptive communications or websites
		- protect by educating employees against brand impersonation
	- Typosquatting
		- URL hijacking
		- example: an attacker might register a domain like "Gnail.com" hoping to catch users who misspell "gmail.com"
		- By registering a hijacked subdomain using the primary domain of a trusted cloud provider, such as azure.com
		- Organizations will often register common misspellings of their own domain names and conduct user security awareness training
	- Watering Hole Attacks
		- metaphore for a regularly used website or online service
