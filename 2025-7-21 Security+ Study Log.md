| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zero Trust**                            | is a cybersecurity approach that assumes no user or system is trusted by default and requires continuous verification for access to organizational resources                                            |
| **control plane**                         | The overarching framework and set of components responsible for  defining, managing, and enforcing the policies related to user and system access within an organization                                |
| **Adaptive Identity**                     | Use adaptive identities that rely on real-time validation that takes into account the user's behavior, device, location, and more                                                                       |
| **Threat Scope Reduction**                | Limit the users' access to only what they need for their work tasks because this drastically reduces the network's potential attack surface                                                             |
| **Policy-Driven access controls**         | Entails developing, managing, and enforcing user access policies based on their roles and responsibilities                                                                                              |
| **Secured zones **                        | Isolated environments within a network that designed to house sensitive data                                                                                                                            |
| **data plane**                            | the component that **enforces security policies in real-time** as data flows through the network. It's where the actual "never trust, always verify" principle gets executed.                           |
| **Subject/system**                        | Refers to the individual or entity attempting to gain access                                                                                                                                            |
| **Policy Enforcement Point**              | Allow or restrict access, and it will effectively act as a gatekeeper to the sensitive areas of the systems or networks                                                                                 |
|                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Gap Analysis**                          | Process of evaluating the differences between an organization's current performance and its desired performance                                                                                         |
