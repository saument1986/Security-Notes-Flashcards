### Important Points

**Blockchain Technology:**
- **Core Structure**: Each block contains previous hash, timestamp, and transaction data forming immutable chain
- **Decentralization**: Uses peer-to-peer network without central authority for trust and verification
- **Beyond Cryptocurrency**: Applications include supply chain management, voting systems, property transfers, IP protection
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated execution eliminates intermediaries, provides transparency, reduces fraud costs
- **Commercial Applications**: IBM's permissioned blockchain for business transactions with enhanced trust/transparency
- **Immutable Ledger**: Cannot modify historical data, provides complete traceability from origin to destination

**Encryption Tools:**
- **TPM Applications**: Commonly used with BitLocker drive encryption, stores keys in isolated hardware
- **HSM vs TPM**: HSM is enterprise "bank vault," TPM is personal "vault" - HSM for mission-critical operations
- **KMS Centralization**: Controls entire key lifecycle from creation to destruction, essential for large-scale operations
- **Secure Enclave Examples**: Apple's Face ID/Touch ID store biometric data separately from main processor
- **Hardware Security**: All tools provide hardware-level protection against software-based attacks
- **Compliance Requirements**: HSMs often required for regulatory compliance in financial/healthcare sectors

**Obfuscation Techniques:**
- **Steganography vs Encryption**: Steganography hides existence of message, encryption secures known messages
- **Tokenization Benefits**: Reduces PCI DSS compliance scope, protects actual data in separate vault
- **Data Masking Use Cases**: Testing environments, employee access control, regulatory compliance
- **File Size Changes**: Steganography may alter file sizes, potential detection method
- **Combined Approaches**: Often used together (steganography + encryption) for enhanced security
- **Business Applications**: Credit card processing, medical records, software development testing

**Cryptographic Attacks:**
- **Downgrade Attack Prevention**: Phase out legacy protocols, implement version intolerance checks
- **POODLE Example**: Real-world downgrade attack forcing SSL 3.0 usage despite TLS availability  
- **Birthday Paradox**: With 23 people, 50% chance of shared birthday; applies to hash collisions
- **MD5 Vulnerability**: Proven collision attacks led to deprecation for security applications
- **Quantum Threat Timeline**: No operational quantum computers today, estimate 2030+ for government/corporate use
- **Current vs Future**: Symmetric encryption (AES) more resistant than asymmetric (RSA/ECC) to quantum attacks

**Post-Quantum Cryptography:**
- **Key Size Method**: Doubling key length squares possible combinations (AES-128 â†’ AES-256)
- **NIST Standards**: 2022 competition selected 4 algorithms after 6-year evaluation process
- **Lattice-Based Crypto**: Most recommended algorithms focus on structured lattice problem difficulty
- **Implementation Ready**: Algorithms work on today's classical computers but resist quantum attacks
- **Migration Planning**: Organizations should begin planning post-quantum transitions now

**Risk Management Process:**
- **Five Phases**: Identification â†’ Analysis â†’ Treatment â†’ Monitoring â†’ Reporting (cyclical process)
- **Proactive Approach**: Focus on prevention rather than reaction to risk events
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Risk reporting must be tailored to audience needs and decision-making
- **Dynamic Process**: Continuous monitoring ensures responsiveness to internal/external changes
- **Strategic Alignment**: All risk activities must support organizational objectives and risk appetite

**Risk Assessment Frequency:**
- **Selection Factors**: Depends on organization nature, risk types, environmental changes
- **Ad-hoc Triggers**: New products, market entry, regulatory changes, natural disasters
- **Recurring Schedule**: Annual (strategic), quarterly (operational), monthly (tactical)
- **Technology Enablement**: Continuous assessments require real-time monitoring systems
- **Cost-Benefit Balance**: Frequency must justify resources spent vs. risk reduction achieved

**Business Impact Analysis:**
- **Critical Function Priority**: Identify and rank business functions by importance to operations
- **Time-Based Metrics**: RTO focuses on recovery time, RPO focuses on acceptable data loss
- **Reliability Measures**: MTTR (repair speed), MTBF (failure frequency) guide maintenance strategies
- **Tolerance Thresholds**: Organizations set maximum acceptable downtime/data loss levels
- **Recovery Planning**: BIA results drive disaster recovery and business continuity planning

**Risk Register Management:**
- **Complete Documentation**: Description, impact, likelihood, outcome, cost, owner, KRIs all required
- **Risk Appetite Types**: Expansionary (high risk/return), Conservative (low risk/return), Neutral (balanced)
- **Prioritization Matrix**: Combine impact and likelihood to determine risk level (high/medium/low)
- **Early Warning Systems**: KRIs provide forward-looking view to enable proactive risk management
- **Accountability Structure**: Clear risk ownership ensures someone responsible for monitoring/mitigation
