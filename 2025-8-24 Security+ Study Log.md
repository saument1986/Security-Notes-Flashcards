| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Automated method of probing networks, systems and applications to discover potential vulnerabilities | 4 |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Comprehensive analysis of scan data to determine which vulnerabilities require immediate attention | 4 |
| **Threat Intelligence** | Continual process to understand threats faced by an organization using evidence-based knowledge | 4 |
| **Responsible Disclosure** | Ethical framework for security researchers to report vulnerabilities to organizations before public disclosure | 4 |

### Vulnerability Identification Methods

| Method | Description | Domain |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Automated tools (Nessus, OpenVAS) analyzing systems against known vulnerability databases | 4 |
| **Static Analysis (SAST)** | Analyzing application source code without executing it to identify potential vulnerabilities | 4 |
| **Dynamic Analysis (DAST)** | Evaluating applications while running using tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Peach Fuzzing | 4 |
| **Package Monitoring** | Ensuring application libraries and dependencies are secure using tools like Snyk, Dependabot | 4 |
| **Penetration Testing** | Simulating real-world attacks to evaluate security posture and identify exploitable vulnerabilities | 4 |
| **System and Process Audits** | Comprehensive review of information systems, security policies and procedures | 4 |

### Threat Intelligence Sources

| Source Type | Description | Domain |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** | Publicly available threat information from security communities and researchers | 4 |
| **Proprietary/Third-Party Feeds** | Commercial threat intelligence services (FireEye, etc.) providing subscription-based threat data | 4 |
| **Information Sharing Organizations** | Industry groups and government agencies sharing threat intelligence across sectors | 4 |
| **Dark Web Intelligence** | Monitoring criminal forums and marketplaces for emerging threats and attack methods | 4 |

### Vulnerability Analysis Components

| Component | Purpose | Domain |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Severity Assessment** | Evaluating the potential impact of identified vulnerabilities using standardized scoring systems | 4 |
| **Risk Prioritization** | Ranking vulnerabilities based on exploitability, impact, and organizational context | 4 |
| **Attack Vector Analysis** | Understanding how vulnerabilities could be exploited by threat actors | 4 |
| **Business Impact Assessment** | Determining potential damage to operations, data, and reputation if exploited | 4 |

### Vulnerability Scanning Types

| Scan Type | Characteristics | Domain |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Network Scans** | Automated discovery of network-accessible vulnerabilities across infrastructure | 4 |
| **Host-Based Scans** | Detailed analysis of individual systems including OS, applications, and configurations | 4 |
| **Application Scans** | Specialized scanning for web applications and custom software vulnerabilities | 4 |
| **Database Scans** | Targeted analysis of database systems for configuration and access control issues | 4 |
| **Wireless Scans** | Assessment of wireless network security configurations and access points | 4 |

### Remediation Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Domain |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Patching** | Applying vendor-provided fixes to address known vulnerabilities | 4 |
| **Configuration Changes** | Modifying system settings to reduce vulnerability exposure | 4 |
| **Compensating Controls** | Implementing alternative security measures when direct fixes aren't available | 4 |
| **Risk Acceptance** | Formal acknowledgment and acceptance of vulnerability risk with documentation | 4 |
| **System Isolation** | Segregating vulnerable systems to limit potential impact | 4 |

### Validation Methods

| Method | Purpose | Domain |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Remediation Scanning** | Re-scanning systems after fixes to verify vulnerabilities have been addressed | 4 |
| **Penetration Testing** | Validating that remediated vulnerabilities can no longer be exploited | 4 |
| **Configuration Auditing** | Verifying that security configurations remain in place over time | 4 |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Ongoing assessment to ensure vulnerabilities don't reappear | 4 |

## üìå Important Points

### Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
- **Four-Step Process**: Planning ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Auditing
- **Planning**: Establish policies, procedures, and mechanisms for systematic vulnerability tracking
- **Testing**: Evaluate patches in controlled environments before enterprise deployment
- **Implementation**: Deploy fixes across necessary devices and applications
- **Auditing**: Verify security patches and configuration changes were implemented effectively

### Application Security Techniques
- **Static Analysis**: Manual code review or automated tools to analyze source code without execution
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Real-time application testing using tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite
- **Package Monitoring**: Continuous scanning of application dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Integration**: Combine multiple techniques for comprehensive application security coverage

### Threat Intelligence Evolution
- **Historical Context**: Attackers shifted from server-side to client-side attacks as servers became better protected
- **Current Focus**: Client-side vulnerabilities in browsers, email clients, and end-user applications
- **Business Value**: Commercial threat intelligence services provide subscription-based threat data and analysis
- **Organizational Context**: Different organizations face different threat landscapes based on their industry and mission

### Vulnerability Scanning Best Practices
- **Tool Selection**: Popular tools include Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys, and Rapid7 Nexpose
- **Database Updates**: Regular updates to vulnerability databases ensure detection of latest threats
- **Scan Types**: Network, host-based, application, database, and wireless scans each serve different purposes
- **Frequency**: Regular scanning schedules based on risk tolerance and regulatory requirements

### Responsible Disclosure Programs
- **Ethical Framework**: Structured process for security researchers to report vulnerabilities
- **Bug Bounty Programs**: Financial incentives for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities
- **Coordination**: Allows organizations time to develop and deploy fixes before public disclosure
- **Community Building**: Fosters collaboration between security researchers and organizations

### Vulnerability Assessment Methodology
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Review all scan data, not just high-severity findings
- **Contextual Analysis**: Consider organizational environment and business impact
- **False Positive Management**: Identify and filter out incorrect vulnerability reports
- **Prioritization Matrix**: Combine severity scores with business context for remediation priorities

### Response and Remediation Planning
- **Immediate Actions**: Critical vulnerabilities may require emergency patching or system isolation
- **Structured Approach**: Non-critical issues can follow standard change management processes
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance security needs with operational requirements and available resources
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of vulnerabilities, remediation actions, and validation results

### Validation and Continuous Improvement
- **Verification Methods**: Multiple techniques to confirm vulnerabilities have been properly addressed
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous assessment to prevent vulnerability reappearance
- **Process Improvement**: Regular review and refinement of vulnerability management procedures
- **Metrics and Reporting**: Track key performance indicators for vulnerability management effectiveness
