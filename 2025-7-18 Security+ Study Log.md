| Term                                              | Definition                                                                                                                                                           | Domain |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Audit Trail**                                   | Provides a chronological record of all user activities that can be used to trace changes, unauthorized access, or anomalies back to a specific user or point in time | 4      |
| **Accounting**                                    | Security measure that ensures all user activities are properly tracked and recorded                                                                                  | 4      |
| **Authorization**                                 | A set of rules and policies that are used to dictate what actions users can perform once verified                                                                    | 3      |
| **Technical controls**                            | The technologies, hardware and software mechanisms that are implemented to manage and reduce risks                                                                   | 1      |
| **Managerial controls** "Administrative controls" | Involve the strategic planning and governance side of security                                                                                                       | 1      |
| **Operational Controls**                          | Procedures and measures that are designed to protect data on a  day to day basis and are mainly governed by internal processes and human actions                     | 1      |
| **Physical controls**                             | Tangible, real-world measures taken to protect assets                                                                                                                | 1      |
| **Preventive Controls**                           | Proactive measures implemented to thwart potential security threats or breaches                                                                                      | 1      |
| **Deterrent Controls**                            | Aim to discourage potential attackers by making the effort seem less appealing or more challenging                                                                   | 1      |
| **Detective Controls**                            | Monitor and alert orginaztions to malicious activities as they occur or shortly therafter                                                                            | 1      |
| **Compensating Controls**                         | Alternative measures that are implemented when primary security controls are not feasible or effective                                                               | 1      |
| **Directive Controls**                            | Often rooted in policy or documentation and set the standards for behavior within an orgnization                                                                     | 1      |

### Important Points

- **Digital signature** = hash and encrpytion
- **Authorization** = A set of rules and policies that are used to dictate what actions users can perform once verified
- **Accounting** - Security measure that ensures all user activities are properly tracked and recorded
- **control types** = technical controls, managerial controls, operational controls and physical controls
- **Security Control types** = Preventative controls, Deterrent Controls, Detective Controls, Corrective Controls, Compensating Controls, Directive Controls
