### Important Points

- **Viruses**
	- Boot sector virus
		- specific antivirus that looks for boot sector virus
	- Macro Virus
		- embedded in documents or spreadsheets
	- Program Virus
		- infects every time a compromised program is run
	- Multipartite virus
		- Even if a cybersecurity professional finds the program part of the virus and cleans it out from within the operating system, they may have missed the boot sector portion
	- Encrypted Virus
		- Harder for antivirus software to find
	- Polymorphic Virus
		- Morphs so signature based antiviruses cant detect it
	- Metamorphic virus
		- More advanced version of a polymorphic virus
	- Armored virus
		- confuse system or person trying to analyze it
	- Hoax
		- type of technical social engineering
	- Multiple types can be combined to create a sophisticated virus
	- Worm
		- can replicate itself without any user interaction
		- Can infect the workstation and other computing assets
		- can cause disruption to the normal network traffic since they are constantly trying to replicate and spread across the network
		- Can create a DOS
		- worms are best known for spreading far and wide over the internet in a relatively short amount of time
		- *conficker* 
	- Trojans
		- appears to be a piece of desirable software
			- Remote access trojan
				- allows remote access 
	- Ransomware
		- Conducting regular backups
			- backup all important data,files,and systems
		- installing regular software updates
		- providing security awareness training
		- implementing multi-factor authentication for the systems
		- never pay the ransom
		- disconnect from the network
		- notify authorities
		- restore from known good backups after ensuring ransomware has been removed
	- Botnet
		- enables use of processing, memory, storage, and networking without victims consent
		- Made up of a group of zombies
		- Controlled by command and control node
		- Used to store illegal material
		- used to combine processing power to break through different types of encryption
